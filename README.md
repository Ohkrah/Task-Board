# Task-Board
Module 5 Challenge

## Description
The challenge for this activity was to create a task board that allows users to drag and drop tasks between categories such as in progress, to do and done. Each task card should have a delete button that would allow users to delete a card individually. When users drag cards between categories the cards will change color.

## Difficullties

### Color changing
There was difficulty getting the cards to change color based on the category they are in. 

### Drag and Drop
Difficulty getting the drag and drop functionality opperating properly. The cards do not currently drag or drop

### Delete button
There is currently no delete button on the cards

### Date Function
There was difficulty getting the date to a comparable format but it was resolved through outside sources.
